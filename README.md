# Pocket Movie App

## Introduction

Hello everyone!  
In this project, you will build our **Pocket Movie App**, where we can keep track of our favorite movies and set up a "Watch Later" list.  
You will use the ReactJS knowledge you accumulated in previous projects to build the interface and display data from an API.
